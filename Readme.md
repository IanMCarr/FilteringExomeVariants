# Filtering exome variants annotated by VEP

When calling variants from aligned exome data, the variants are typically saved in VCF files. These are text files and so can be read in any text editor like Notepad or preferably Notepad++. Since one line contains data on one variant it is best to use a program that either doesn't wordwrap or allows it to be turned off.
